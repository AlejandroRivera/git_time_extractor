<h2 id="label-DESCRIPTION%3A">DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<p>EXTRACT REASONABLE TIME RECORDS FROM A GIT REPOSITORY</p>

<p>This tool goes through a GIT repository's commit log and prints a CSV dump
of per developer, per day working time based on a few assumptions:</p>

<pre>- A series of commits within a 3 hour window are part of the same development session
- A single commit (or the first commit of the session) is considered to represent 30 minutes of work time
- The more frequent a developer commits to the repository while working, the more accurate the time report will be</pre>

<p>This script is based on previous code published publicly by Sharad at <a
href="http://www.tatvartha.com/2010/01/generating-time-entry-from-git-log/.">www.tatvartha.com/2010/01/generating-time-entry-from-git-log/.</a>
However, it has been adapted to run without Rails from the command line.
