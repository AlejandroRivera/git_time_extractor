<h2 id="label-DESCRIPTION%3A">DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<p>EXTRACT REASONABLE TIME RECORDS FROM A GIT REPOSITORY</p>

<p>git_time_extractor is a free tool that goes through a GIT, the popular
revision control system, repository's commit log and produces a Comma
Separated Values (CSV) file that indicates the time spent by each
developer, per day.</p>

<p>The working time estimates are based on three assumptions:</p>

<pre>1. A series of commits within a 3 hour window are part of the same development session
2. A single commit (or the first commit of the session) is considered to represent 30 minutes of work time
3. The more frequent a developer commits to the repository while working, the more accurate the time report will be</pre>

<p>This script is based on previous code published publicly by Sharad at <a
href="http://www.tatvartha.com/2010/01/generating-time-entry-from-git-log/.">www.tatvartha.com/2010/01/generating-time-entry-from-git-log/.</a>
However, it has been adapted to run without Rails from the command line.
The portions of the code written by Rietta are licensed under the terms of
the BSD license (see section 3 below).</p>

<p>git_time_extractor is useful for software development companies that want
to discover the approximate time spent by developers on particular projects
based on real data in the GIT revision control system. This is useful for
managers, accountants, and for those who need to back up records for tax
purposes.</p>

<p>For example, in the United States there is a Research &amp; Development
(R&amp;D) tax credit available for companies who build or improve software
for certain purposes.  To claim this credit requires certain types of
records.  Check with your accountant to see if the results from this
program is appropriate in your particular situation.  You can learn more
information about this particular credit at <a
href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/article/0,,id=156366,00.html.">www.irs.gov/businesses/article/0,,id=156366,00.html.</a></p>

<h2 id="label-BENEFITS%3A">BENEFITS:</h2>

<pre>* Compute time records based on the timestamps of each code commit by each developer
* Compare these results with other time-sheets or metrics to measure the effectiveness of your team members
* Save money on taxes by producing documents required by your accountant to properly apply for certain tax credits
* It's a Free Open Source Tool</pre>

<h2 id="label-FEATURES%3A">FEATURES:</h2>

<pre>* Easy command-line operation
* Reads from a local GIT branch in the current directory
* Writes to a CSV-file that is compatible with Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice Calc, or Google Docs</pre>

<h2 id="label-SYNOPSIS%3A">SYNOPSIS:</h2>

<pre>cd /path/to/your/repository
git_time_extractor &gt; time_log.csv</pre>

<h2 id="label-REQUIREMENTS%3A">REQUIREMENTS:</h2>
